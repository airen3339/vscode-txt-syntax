## Folding function

Text between sections, braces or hypertext markups could be folded.

Section headers like these:

```
-*-
* xxx
[xxx]
Part I.
Section A
Page 1
A. 
1. 
一 xx
甲、xxx
第一章 xxx
第2回 xxx
第 3 节 xxx
...
```

You could set `"files.defaultLanguage": "txt"` or `"files.associations": {"Untitled-*": "txt"}` in **settings.json** to let vscode treat all **Untitled files** as txt files and then txt syntax will be enabled for these files automatically.
In additon, you could also install [Modelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrislajoie.vscode-modelines) extension to set a file to a special format.

**note**: It will override the default highlight schemes supported by visual studio code if you active this extension.
